### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ :wave::skin-tone-3:

I am currently a graduate student at the University of California, Irvine, where I am studying Business Analytics. Prior to this I majored in Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley, where I graduated in the Spring of 2020.

Currently I serve as a Program Ambassador, which means I represent the MSBA Program to potential admits during webinars, at hackathons, and at other events! I am focused on a Data Analytics track within the MSBA Program, where I am expanding my technical skills, improving my ability to handle and understand data, and widening my business domain expertise. If you have any questions shoot me an email at matthias.ronnau@uci.edu!
