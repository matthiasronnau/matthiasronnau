### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am recent graduate student of the University of California, Irvine, where I studied Business Analytics. Prior to this I majored in Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley, where I graduated in the Spring of 2020.

Currently, I am working on expanding my technical toolkit by learning web scraping so that I can better access necessary data for any given project. Keep a look out for exciting projects involving this and other data analysis on my GitHub.

I am actively searching for Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and Business Analyst roles in all fields. If you know of something that may be a good fit, please check out my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12SwhG-R3WnT0Cqg56DAyNwSYjkzjWsPM/view?usp=sharing) and send me an email at matthias.ronnau@uci.edu. Thank you!
